<li><h4> Cashier at Santander February 2019</h4>
I completed a two-week work experience placement at Santander, as a bank cashier I completed tasks such as
customer service transactions, observing meetings and providing assistance if needed
</li><li>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp</li>
<li>Key Achievements:</li>
<li>      &nbsp</li>
<li> • I gained excellent communication skills and confidence when completing customer service</li>
<li>      &nbsp</li>
<li> • I learnt how to work efficiently and effectively under pressure for example in large waves of customers I completed
deposits and withdrawals in a short amount of time</li>
<li>      &nbsp</li>
<li> • I was offered a full-time job for when I turned 16
</li>
<li>      &nbsp</li>
<li></li> <h4>Voluntary work:</h4> I help out at the local Gurdwara temple where I help in the kitchen cook and serve langar (free meals
served to anyone regardless of religion, caste, gender, economic status, or ethnicity).
<li>      &nbsp</li>
• To continue I completed the NCS program, in the last week of the program me and my team were tasked with
creating a service that would help combat a problem in our society. We chose to tackle homelessness so we
came up with a charity that would provide essential items to homeless centres, we came up with the name
Esential Assistance. I used my skills gained in Graphics to make a logo and stencil which I used to make T-
shirts we wore to spread awareness. In only a week we raised £140 Which was all spent on food, Water and

other health care items that were donated to a local Booth homeless centre.</li>
